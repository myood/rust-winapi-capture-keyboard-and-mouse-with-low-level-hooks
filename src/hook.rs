///             .with_mouse()
///             .build();

///             .with_mouse()
///             .build();

/// assert!(hook.is_some());
/// // It could go out of scope as well, but let's drop it explicitly:
/// drop(hook);
/// // Since there is no "active" hook at the moment, now we can create another:
/// let another_hook = HookBuilder::new().with_keyboard().build();
/// assert!(another_hook.is_some());
